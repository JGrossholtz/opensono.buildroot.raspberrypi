This Buildroot repository is a Raspberry-pi OS for the Opensono project. ( https://github.com/JGrossholtz/opensono.buildroot.raspberrypi ).

To build the Opensono full OS do the following :

#Get the opensono configuration
$ make opensono_defconfig

#Start the creation process :
$ make

#In the meantime you can prepare an SD card for your Raspberry. You need 2 partitions. You can Follow the part 4 of this article on my blog : http://agrou.eu/en/a-custom-made-operating-system-for-your-raspberry-pi-with-buildroot/
The idea is only to create a 10mb FAT32 bootable partition. And a second one with the remaining space in ext3 or ext4.

#In the end of the building process you will be asked for the path of those 2 partition. An opensono script will extract the data to your sd card. After this you should be able to boot the system.
